## Developer Stories for the Emoji Story Application Project

1. **Story Submission**
   - As a developer, I need to create an interface displaying the pool of eight predetermined emojis.
   - As a developer, I need to implement functionality for users to submit their selection for the next part of the story using `socket.io`.

2. **Voting System**
   - As a developer, I need to create a server-side function to handle emoji votes using `socket.io`.
   - As a developer, I need to implement real-time updating of vote counts so that users can see how many votes each emoji choice has received.

3. **Story Progression**
   - As a developer, I need to implement a timer function that triggers the server to check for the highest voted emoji after 20 seconds.
   - As a developer, I need to implement functionality for broadcasting the chosen emoji to all connected clients and appending it to the ongoing story.

4. **Story Conclusion**
   - As a developer, I need to create a voting mechanism for users to vote on when they believe the emoji story should end.
   - As a developer, I need to define functionality for ending the story when a majority of user votes indicate so.
   - As a developer, I need to implement an option for starting a new story after the current one ends.

5. **AI-Generated Story**
   - As a developer, I need to integrate an AI model to generate a written story based on the sequence of chosen emojis.
   - As a developer, I need to implement options for users to save or share this AI-written story.

6. **New Story Creation**
   - As a developer, I require to refresh the user interface and server-side state after the AI-written story has been presented, allowing a new story to start.

7. **User Experience**
   - As a developer, I need to ensure a user-friendly UI using `Next.js` with `Tailwind CSS`, making it easy for users to participate in the story creation process.
   - As a developer, I need to ensure the application is responsive and accessible from different types of devices.

8. **Testing and Deployment**
   - As a developer, I need to create unit and integration tests to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
   - As a developer, I need to deploy the application to a production environment using a service like Vercel or Netlify.

These developer stories directly map to the user stories in your roadmap and details the implementation strategy required to fulfill those user demands. They are highly platform-specific, focusing on `nestjs`, `socket.io`, `Next.js` and `Tailwind CSS`.
